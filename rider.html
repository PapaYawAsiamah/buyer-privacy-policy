        <h1>Rider Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 21, 2025</p>

        <p>Thank you for partnering with qwikbasket as a rider. This Rider Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect the personal information of riders who use our rider app.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
        <p>When you register and use the rider app, we collect information you provide directly, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Full Name:</strong> To identify your account and communicate for operational purposes</li>
            <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> For account creation, important communications, and notifications</li>
            <li><strong>Phone Number:</strong> For delivery coordination, SMS/phone notifications, and verification</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Location Information</h3>
        <p>To enable delivery assignments, routing, and estimated arrival times, we collect precise location information from your device when you use the rider app. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Real-time GPS location while you are logged in and performing deliveries</li>
            <li>Last known location when the app is running in the background (if you grant background location permission)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can control location access through your device settings. Denying location access may prevent you from receiving delivery assignments.</p>

        <h3>Push Notifications</h3>
        <p>We request permission to send push notifications to your device to deliver time-sensitive information such as new delivery requests, cancellations, updates, and system announcements. You can opt-out of notifications via your device settings; however, disabling notifications may impact timely communication.</p>

        <h3>Device & Usage Information</h3>
        <p>We automatically collect certain device and usage information, such as device type, operating system, app version, IP address, and crash reports to help improve the app and troubleshoot issues.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create and manage your rider account</li>
            <li>Assign deliveries and provide routing and navigation</li>
            <li>Contact you about delivery details and safety notifications</li>
            <li>Verify your identity and help prevent fraud</li>
            <li>Improve our platform, analyze performance, and fix bugs</li>
            <li>Comply with legal obligations and respond to lawful requests</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following situations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> With vendors who provide services such as mapping, hosting, messaging, and payment processing</li>
            <li><strong>Restaurants & Customers:</strong> Your name and limited contact/location information may be shared with restaurants or customers strictly to complete deliveries</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> When required by law or to protect rights, safety, or property</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, with notice and safeguards where required</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to provide the services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. When no longer needed, we will securely delete or anonymize the information.</p>

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information. While we strive to protect rider data, no system is completely secure; please take care when sharing sensitive information.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>You have certain choices regarding your personal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request access to the personal information we hold about you</li>
            <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete information</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Request deletion of your personal information (subject to legal limitations)</li>
            <li><strong>Location & Notifications:</strong> Manage location and notification permissions via your device settings</li>
            <li><strong>Account Closure:</strong> You can deactivate or delete your rider account following the in-app process or by contacting us</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Children</h2>
        <p>The rider app is intended for individuals 18 years or older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under 18. If you believe we have collected data from a minor, contact us immediately.</p>

        <h2>8. International Transfers</h2>
        <p>Your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in countries other than your country of residence. We apply appropriate safeguards to protect your data when transferred internationally.</p>
